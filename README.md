# allFourLetterWords
A simple JS program for displaying all possible four-letter words.

# Notes

* In the standard 26-word alphabet, there are 26^4 possible
combinations that can make a 4-letter word. This comes to
456,976 words.
* The function can take any array of characters. For example,
the Greek alphabet, or Katakana/Hiragana could be used. 
* The function, as it is now, is limited to four-letter 
words. 

# Other Approaches

* Another approach to this problem would be to create 
some kind of counting system, using the length of the 
array as its base, and counting within a certain number
of digits.
